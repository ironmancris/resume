		"summary": "I like to fix old stuff: from 9 to 6 mostly software, after that it's usually my motorcycle. At any moment there is something wearing and tearing out, that needs replacement or upgrade. Yet both must keep running reliably. I also like to make things from scratch; get my hands dirty. As a kid I used to play with LEGO. Nowadays I mostly play with software, trying to experiment with and learn new design patterns everyday. For these reasons I appreciate flexible and expressive programming languages. I don't like routine duties; I try to make good use of CI and automation. I always try to give constructive feedback whenever possible, otherwise I keep my opinions for myself.",
