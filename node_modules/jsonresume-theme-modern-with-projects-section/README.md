jsonresume-theme-modern-with-projects-section
=======================

Schema to include personal projects: 
```javascript
  "personalProjects": [
    {
      "title": "Vanity",
      "description": "A notification broadcast platform for SaaS",
      "highlights": [
        "Written in python(django) and uses AngularJs on the client",
        "Enables creating new notifications, just by shooting an email"
      ],
      "status": "Finished",
      "website": "ethernet.cloudapp.net:8000"
    }
  ]
```

Add the above object as a root section in your `resume.json`.

To generate html: 
```
resume export myResume.html --theme modern-with-projects-section --format html 
```

That's pretty much it!
